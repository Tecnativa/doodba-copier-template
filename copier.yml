    Now, let's start configuring outgoing mail.

smtp_relay_host:
  type: str
  help: >-
    ⚠️ If you leave this answer empty, all next SMTP settings will be ignored.

    If you supply a valid SMTP host, production Odoo will be able to send emails without
    needing to configure any `ir.mail_server` record, because Doodba will configure it
    to use a mail relay that will manage a local mail queue before sending it to the
    real SMTP endpoint (saving your mails from bad network conditions). The same relay
    will be used to send backup reports.

    So, what is your SMTP host?

    Example: mail.example.com

smtp_relay_port:
  type: int
  default: 587

    Usually, if you send mails like "user@example.com", the canonical domain would be
    "example.com".

    This canonical domain should have correct SPF, DKIM and DMARC settings that allow
    the SMTP host to send mails in its name.

    When Odoo tries to send a mail that does not come from a canonical domain, the
    domain you indicate here will be used when rewriting the address with SRS
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRS).

    What's your canonical domain?

smtp_canonical_domains:
  when: *has_smtp
  help: >-
    Supply a list of other domains authorized to send email from this Odoo instance and
    SMTP host. They will not be affected by SRS. They also must have valid SPF, DKIM and
