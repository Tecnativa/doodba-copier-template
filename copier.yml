    If you host this project in Gitlab, then please enter here the host URL.

    It must have no trailing slash.

    💡 If you don't use Gitlab, leave this empty and ignore all other Gitlab questions.

    Example: If you project is in https://gitlab.com/Tecnativa/your-doodba-project, then
    the correct value here is `https://gitlab.com`.

gitlab_org:

  default: Tecnativa
  help: >-
    If you host this project in Gitlab, then please enter here the organization name.

gitlab_ci_templates_project:
  type: str
  default: ci-templates
  help: >-
    Gitlab CI lets you include repeated instructions in a template. See
    https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#includefile to understand how.

    If you share gitlab CI templates in a project in your gitlab instance, tell me that
    project's name here. We assume it is under the same organization that the doodba
    project.

    Example: If you project is in https://gitlab.com/Tecnativa/your-doodba-project and
    the shared templates exist in https://gitlab.com/Tecnativa/ci-templates then the
    correct value for this variable is `ci-templates`.

gitlab_ci_templates_path:
  type: str
  default: /doodba/main.yml
  help: >-
    If you use a shared template, then tell me where to find it in the project you
    specified before.

domain_prod:
  type: str
  help: >-
    Write the main production domain for this project. Only the domain, no protocol or
    things like that.

    Example: www.example.com

domain_prod_alternatives:
  help: >-
    Write a list of alternative domains that should produce a 301 redirection to the
    main domain.

    Example: [example.com, www.example.org, example.org]

domain_test:
  type: str
  help: >-
    Write the test domain for this project. Only the domain, no protocol or things like
    that.

    Example: demo.example.com

odoo_version:
  help: On which odoo version is it based?
  type: float
  default: 13.0

    - 10.0
    - 11.0
    - 12.0
    - 13.0

odoo_initial_lang:
  default: en_US
  type: str
  help: >-
    If you want to initialize Odoo automatically in a specific language, write it here.
    The format must be ll_CC where ll is the language code and CC is the country code.

    Examples: en_US, es_ES, es_VE...

odoo_oci_image:
  type: str
  help: >-
    If you are using an OCI/Docker image registry (such as the Docker Hub, Quay or
    Gitlab registry) to publish the Odoo images that will be built with this Doodba
    project, specify here the path to the odoo image built with it. Leave it empty if
    you are not using a registry.

    Example: docker.io/myteam/example-odoo

odoo_listdb:
  default: false
  type: bool
  help: >-
    Do you want to list databases publicly?

odoo_admin_password:
  secret: true
  default: example-admin-password
  type: str
  help: >-
    💡 To auto-generate strong passwords, see https://ddg.gg/?q=password+64+strong

    ⚠️ This password is critical for security, especially if you have set odoo_listdb to
    true, so keep it safe.

    What will be your odoo admin password?

odoo_dbfilter:
  default: ".*"
  type: str
  help: >-
    Set your Odoo db filter. It must be a regexp that matches the domain name being
    visited. It is useful if you use Odoo in SaaS mode.

odoo_proxy:
  default: traefik
  choices:
    No proxy (dangerous for production): null
    Traefik: traefik
    Other proxy (it's up to you!): other
  help: >-
    ⚠️ Using a misconfigured proxy for production can create a security hole. Using none
    can create performance problems.

    Which proxy will you use to deploy odoo?

postgres_version:
  default: 12
  help: >-
    Which PostgreSQL version do you want to deploy?
  choices:
    I will use an external PostgreSQL server: null
    "9.6": 9.6
    "10": 10
    "11": 11
    "12": 12

postgres_username:
  type: str
  default: odoo
  help: >-
    Which user name will be used to connect to the postgres server?

postgres_dbname:
  type: str
  default: prod
  help: >-
    💡 If database names differ among environments, operations like restoring a database
    from an alien environment will be harder to maintain, but can provide additional
    security. It's up to you. We default to "prod" for historical reasons.

    What is going to be the main database name?

postgres_password:
  secret: true
  default: example-db-password
  type: str
  help: >-
    What will be your postgres user password?

smtp_default_from:
  type: str
  help: >-
    Now, let's start configuring outgoing mail.

    In case an email coming out from odoo doesn't have a valid `From:` header address,
    which address should be the default one that sends the email?

smtp_relay_host:
  type: str
  help: >-
    ⚠️ If you leave this answer empty, all next SMTP settings will be ignored.

    If you supply a valid SMTP host, production Odoo will be able to send emails without
    needing to configure any `ir.mail_server` record, because Doodba will configure it
    to use a mail relay that will manage a local mail queue before sending it to the
    real SMTP endpoint (saving your mails from bad network conditions). The same relay
    will be used to send backup reports.

    So, what is your SMTP host?

    Example: mail.example.com

smtp_relay_port:
  type: int
  default: 587
  help: >-
    Indicate the port to connect in the SMTP server you just defined.

smtp_relay_user:
  type: str
  help: >-
    Indicate the user to connect in the SMTP server you just defined.

    For Odoo to work fine, this user needs to be able to do mail spoofing.

smtp_relay_password:
  secret: true
  type: str
  default: example-smtp-password
  help: >-
    What is your SMTP password?

smtp_canonical_default:
  type: str
  help: >-
    Usually, if you send mails like "user@example.com", the canonical domain would be
    "example.com".

    This canonical domain should have correct SPF, DKIM and DMARC settings that allow
    the SMTP host to send mails in its name.

    When Odoo tries to send a mail that does not come from a canonical domain, the
    domain you indicate here will be used when rewriting the address with SRS
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRS).

    What's your canonical domain?

smtp_canonical_domains:
  help: >-
    Supply a list of other domains authorized to send email from this Odoo instance and
    SMTP host. They will not be affected by SRS. They also must have valid SPF, DKIM and
    DMARC settings.

    You do not need to repeat the canonical domain you indicated above.

    Example: [examplemail.com, example.org]

backup_dst:
  type: str
  help: >-
    If you want to use an Amazon S3 bucket, write its URL like
    `s3://s3.amazonaws.com/example-bucket/example/path` to make sure it works fine.

    If you want to use any other backend, supply any URL supported by Duplicity (our
    choice backup engine; read http://duplicity.nongnu.org/vers8/duplicity.1.html#sect7
    for those URL formats).

    If you don't want bakcups, leave this empty.

    Where should the backups be stored?

backup_email_from:
  type: str
  help: >-
    The backup container will send email reports if the SMTP relay is properly
    configured.

    What email address should it use to send them?

backup_email_to:
  type: str
  help: >-
    Where to send those backup reports?

backup_deletion:
  type: bool
  help: >-
    If you're using S3, you probably want to delete outdated backups using bucket
    lifecycle rules. If you use other storage backend, then you probably want to enable
    outdated backups deletion using duplicity itself.

    So, do you want to enable duplicity backup deletion via cron?

backup_tz:
  type: str
  default: UTC
  help: >-
    Set the timezone used by the backup cron for reports.

    Visit https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-set-tz-environment-variable/ to know
    how to obtain a valid value for this variable.

backup_aws_access_key_id:
  type: str
  default: null
  help: >-
    If you're using AWS S3 to store backups, provide here your access key ID.

backup_aws_secret_access_key:
  type: str
  default: null
  help: >-
    If you're using AWS S3 to store backups, provide here your secret access key.

backup_passphrase:
  secret: true
  type: str
  default: example-backup-passphrase
  help: >-
    ⚠️ This passphrase is critical for security, so keep it safe. You will need it to
    restore backups.

    Which will be your backups passphrase?
