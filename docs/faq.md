## Can I have my own private template?

Yes, and thanks to Copier, you can combine both in the same subproject.

Just make sure to use a separate answers file so both don't mix:

```bash
# For the 1st copy
copier --answers-file .copier-answers.private.yml copy gh:Tecnativa/private-template .
# For updates
copier --answers-file .copier-answers.private.yml update .
```

Check Copier docs for more details.

## Can I use environments for what they're not?

You want to know if you can use `devel.yaml` to serve a production instance?

Wel... yes, you _can_, but it's not recommended nor supported.

## How can I run a Posbox/IoT box service for development?

Posbox has special needs that are not useful for most projects, and is quite tightly
related to specific hardware and peripherals, so it makes not much sense to ship it by
default in this template.

However, for testing connection issues, developing, etc., you might want to boot a
resource-limited posbox instance imitation.

The best you can do is buy a Posbox/IoT box and peripherals and use it, but for quick
tests that do not involve specific hardware, you can boot it with Doodba by:

- Add the `apt` dependency `usbutils` (which contains `lsusb` binary).
- Add the `pip` dependencies `evdev` and `netifaces`.
- Add a `posbox` container, which:
  - Can read usb devices, privileged.
  - Loads at boot all required `hw_*` addons, except for `hw_posbox_upgrade`.
  - Exposes a port that doesn't conflict with Odoo, such as `8070` i.e.

Once you apply those changes, to use it:

1. `invoke img-build --pull` to install the new dependencies.
1. `invoke start` to start all services.
1. Visit `http://localhost:8070` to see the posbox running.
1. Visit `http://localhost:${ODOO_MAJOR}069` to see Odoo (e.g.: `$ODOO_MAJOR` is `13` if
   deploying Odoo 13.0).
1. Install `point_of_sale` in Odoo.
1. Configure the POS in Odoo to connect to Posbox in `localhost:8070`.

Of course this won't be fully functional, but it will give you an overview on the posbox
stuff.

## How can I whitelist a service and allow external access to it?

This can become useful when you have isolated environments (like in `devel.yaml` and
`test.yaml` by default) but you need to allow some external API access for them. I.e.,
you could use Google Fonts API for your customer's reports, and those reports would take
forever and end up rendering badly in staging environments.

In such case, we recommend using the
[tecnativa/whitelist](https://hub.docker.com/r/tecnativa/whitelist/) image. Read its
docs there.

## How do I develop for an external repo, such as OCA?

You can use the same subproject used to deploy to production.

However, you might find this pattern useful:

1. Have your own "development-only subproject". One per Odoo version.
1. Add the repo there to `addons.yaml`. For example, add `server-tools: ["*"]` to
   develop [OCA's server-tools](https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/).
1. Download code as usual.
1. Develop.
1. Push the PR to Github.
1. Open your production deployment and add that PR to `repos.yaml`.

## How to bootstrap the global inverse proxy?

This is needed for testing and production environments to be reachable.

Our supported proxy is Traefik. There must be one in each node.

To have it, use this `inverseproxy.yaml` file:

<details>
<summary>Traefik v1 docker compose</summary>

```yaml
version: "2.1"

services:
  proxy:
    image: traefik:1.6-alpine

<summary>Traefik v2 docker compose</summary>

</details>

Then boot it up with:

```bash
docker-compose -p inverseproxy -f inverseproxy.yaml up -d
```

This will intercept all requests coming from port 80 (HTTP) and redirect them to port
443 (HTTPS), it will download and install required TLS certificates from
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) whenever you boot a new instance, add the
required proxy headers to the request, and then redirect all traffic to/from odoo
automatically.

It includes
[a security-enhaced proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy/) to
reduce attack surface when listening to the Docker socket.

This allows you to:

- Have multiple domains for each Odoo instance.
- Have multiple Odoo instances in each node.
- Add an TLS layer automatically and for free.

## How to change report fonts?

Doodba ships [Liberation fonts](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts) as
defaults.

If you want to make another font package _available_, just add it to
[`apt.txt`][dependencies] (if it's a normal Debian package) or install it in a [custom
build script][build.d] called i.e. `build.d/200-custom-fonts` (if you need to install it
in a more complex way).

If, in addition to that, you want those fonts to be the _defaults_, then add one (or
more) of these build arguments:

- `FONT_MONO`
- `FONT_SANS`
- `FONT_SERIF`

## How to get proper assets when printing reports?

Make sure there's a `ir.config_parameter` called `report.url` with the value
`http://localhost:8069`.

## How to have good QA and test in my CI with Doodba?

Inside this image, there's the `/qa` folder, which provides some necessary plumbing to
perform quality assurance and continous integration if you use [doodba-qa][], which is a
separate (but related) project with that purpose.

Go there to get more instructions.

## This project is too opinionated, but can I question any of those opinions?

Of course. There's no guarantee that we will like it, but please do it. 😉

## Where are screencasts and screenshots of my failed E2E tests?

Starting with Odoo (and Doodba) 13.0, when you're in [the devel
environment][development] and run some E2E test (tours, JS tests...) that fails, Odoo
will output screenshots and screencasts automatically. These are very useful for
debugging.

You can find them in the `./odoo/auto/test-artifacts` directory in your development
host. No need to sniff around inside the container to find them.

### How to get screencasts and screenshots of failed E2E tests in Odoo 12.0?

In Odoo (and Doodba) 12.0, the screencasts and screenshots feature is also supported,
but it is less intuitive: just apply this patch to your `devel.yaml` file:

```diff
diff --git a/devel.yaml b/devel.yaml
index 2026e7c..d4e5a68 100644
--- a/devel.yaml
+++ b/devel.yaml
@@ -60,6 +60,7 @@ services:
       - --limit-time-real=9999999
       - --workers=0
       - --dev=reload,qweb,werkzeug,xml
+      - --logfile=/opt/auto/test-artifacts/odoo.log

   db:
     extends:
```

You'll find Odoo logs in `./odoo/auto/test-artifacts/odoo.log` file, and screencasts and
screenshots will be around with some weird names. As a side effect, your container will
output no logs to the console.

Since this is an awkward side effect of that setting, we're not shipping that by
default.

## Why pre-commit fails each time I copy or update the template?

We format here YAML files using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) inside
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

However, when the template is generated, you have a lot of chances that your YAML files
are badly formatted. For instance, depending on the length of you alternate domains,
Traefik rules might be longer or shorter, triggering a different reformat on each
project, or on each update. That is expected good behavior.

Also, the way Copier formats your `.copier-answers.yml` file almost always violates
Prettier's rules.

So, if you find out that after generating the project for the 1st time, or after
updating it, it fails pre-commit validations, don't worry about that. Just let
pre-commit reformat your files in next commit, and commit again.

Quick dirty recipe:

```bash
copier --force update
git add .
pre-commit run
git add .
git commit -m 'Update from template'
```

## Why XML is broken after running pre-commit?

Doodba Copier Template enables [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as a
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) formatter for many file formats. One of these is
XML, and we configure Prettier with `xmlWhitespaceSensitivity: "ignore"`. This is like
telling Prettier: "do whatever you need with XML whitespace to prettify XML files".

We do this because most times XML whitespace is meaningless, and prettifying a file
without changing whitespace limits _a lot_ what Prettier can do. However, keep in mind
that _in some cases, it can be meaningful_.

We sometimes use XML in Odoo to generate HTML. In HTML, whitespace matters at least in
these cases:

1. Inside
   [the `<pre>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre).
1. When any element uses
   [the CSS `white-space` style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space)
   with certain values.

So, if you see that after running `pre-commit` some HTML is broken, this is possibly the
cause.

Our recommendation is that, at least, before you run it for the 1st time, search `<pre`
(literally) among your private modules, and in case you find any, be careful about what
Prettier does with them.

If you install Fish, you can run these commands to find those dangerous things. If one
fails with `No matches for wildcard`, it means there are no files to check and thus you
can ignore that error:

```bash
cd $project_root/odoo/custom/src/private
fish -c 'grep "<pre" **.{xml,html}'
fish -c 'grep -E "white-space:\s*(pre|break-spaces)" **.{less,sass,scss,css}'
```

You can wrap any XML code among [ignore tags](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html)
to tell Prettier "don't touch this":

```xml
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<pre>
________________
|              |
|    DOODBA    |
|    RULEZ!    |
|______________|
(\_/)  ||
(•ㅅ•) ||
/ 　 づ
</pre>
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
```

You can also replace our default for `xmlWhitespaceSensitivity: "strict"` inside your
`.prettierrc.yml` file.

## Why is Odoo saying that its database is not initialized?

This is a common problem within the development workflow. From Odoo 12.0, the database
needs to be initialized by hand. You can know that you're facing this problem if you see
in Odoo's logs something like this:

```log
2020-06-09 10:24:26,715 1 ERROR ? odoo.modules.loading: Database devel not initialized, you can force it with `-i base`
2020-06-09 10:25:26,781 1 ERROR devel odoo.sql_db: bad query: SELECT latest_version FROM ir_module_module WHERE name='base'
ERROR: relation "ir_module_module" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT latest_version FROM ir_module_module WHERE name='base...
                                   ^
```

You can do as **the log is clearly telling you to do** (side note: READ THE LOGS! 😀):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm odoo --stop-after-init -i base
invoke restart
```

Or you can use the `resetdb` task to reset your `devel` database:

```bash
invoke resetdb
```

If you use this method, Odoo will have 2 databases created. You should use the one
called `devel`; the other one is just a cache, so the next time you run this command
it's faster.

This is just a helper over these tools, which you might want to use directly instead:

- [`click-odoo-dropdb`](https://github.com/acsone/click-odoo-contrib#click-odoo-dropdb-stable)
- [`click-odoo-initdb`](https://github.com/acsone/click-odoo-contrib#click-odoo-initdb-stable)
